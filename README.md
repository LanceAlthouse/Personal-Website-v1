# Personal Website Version 1.0

Welcome to the source code repository for the first version of my personal website! This project showcases my web development skills, utilizing the React and TailwindCSS frameworks.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find the code that powers my personal website. This README helps in understanding this project and the technologies used to build it. If you find any bugs or issues with the site please document them in the issue tracker on this repo.

## Technologies

### React (Reusable Components)

The main part of this website is made using the React framework. React allows for the creation of reusable UI elements by creating components that update when data changes. It utilizes a virtual DOM to make changes to the actual DOM and manipulate data.

### TailwindCSS (Styling)

The aesthetic of my website was made using TailwindCSS. This CSS framework makes the styling process very quick and easy, offering lots of pre-designed classes that help developers make web pages. TailwindCSS and React go well together as React uses JSX and you can edit styles directly inside it using classNames.

## Deployment Of Website

I used Vercel to deploy my website, making it very quick and easy to set up the React server. I also set up the serverless function that my website uses to send emails.

## Installation On Local System
